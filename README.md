# My Blog 
Freshly new design for blog and portfolio (ongoing projects). So here are the background story of why I stumbled upon onto this old project again: I bought a Mac and Ruby on Rails development are not pain in the turd anymore.

# Tools:
For this project, I'm using tools such as Jade, Sass, Prepros and Sublime Text. For icons, I'm using Font-Awesome CDN. For fonts, I'm using Google Fonts. Did I already tell you that I bought a Mac and Ruby on Rails development are not pain in the turd anymore? (Ow yizz!)
